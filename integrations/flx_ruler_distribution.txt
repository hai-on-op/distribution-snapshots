# How Ruler Rewards Work

You first need to get rcTokens. There are three ways to do this:

1) Go to the RAI market, click on the Mint tab and provide RAI (make sure to enable "Use RAI"). You will get both rcTokens and rrTokens
2) Go to the RAI market, click on the Mint tab and provide DAI
3) Go to the RAI market, click on the Lend tab and lend DAI

Once you get rcTokens, go to this Curve pool and provide DAI + rcTokens, USDC + rcTokens or USDT + rcTokens liquidity:

You will get an LP token back from Curve. You have to use that LP token and stake it in the RAI farm here:

That's how you start to accrue rewards

Ruler also made a video to explain how the protocol can be used:

NOTE: *before* expiration you must unstake from the farm, get back your rcTokens + DAI from Curve and then use the rcTokens to get back your DAI (if you lent DAI) or get back your RAI (if you minted both rrTokens and rcTokens).
