14th of April 2021 1:50 PM UTC+1  - Ongoing -- 15 FLX per day to RAI borrowers (*not* lenders) in the Fuse RAI/FRAX/USDC/DAI pool (https://rari-git-allow-deploys-rari-capital.vercel.app/fuse/pool/9)                       

### Notes

Similar to LP rewards, rewards on Fuse are calculated according to the time x weight of each position. E.g if an address borrows more RAI for a longer period of time than others, it can accrue more rewards.
